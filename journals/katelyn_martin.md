Week 1: project brainstorming. Started with toy trading app ideas, however, we realized setting up an ecommerce site was a bit beyond our capabilities/time frame for this project. We have started with a new idea: ParkIt (crowd-sourced parking spot finder app). Ended the week with finding our API, Bing Maps API, that we will use to populate a list of local public parking areas based on user location.
Week 2:
    Monday: API endpoint design
